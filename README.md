Abstract: Due to the volatility of the stock market, an accurate machine learning model to predict fluctuations in prices could lead to improved return on investments. Previous research has used historical price data to determine future drops and rises in stock prices; however, integrating more factors such as interest rates, inflation rates, and news sentiment into the predictions could potentially improve results. Studies have managed to successfully integrate sentiment analysis into their predictions with some improvement seen in the results (Li, 2020). I used historical price, interest, and inflation data from a public API, with the plan of using sentiment analysis after passing the data through an LSTM, SVM, or ARIMA machine learning model. However, I was unable to integrate sentiment scores due to time constraints. Adding interest and inflation rates did not seem to have a significant impact on the price of the stock, often decreasing accuracy when implemented.
